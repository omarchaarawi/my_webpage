    <div id="about_me"><p>Hi, my name is Omar. I live in Boulder, Colorado where I spend most my days doing treework
    with the "pards". I enjoy my job, but what I really want to do is become a data scientist. This website is part
    of my goal to join the data science world. I am currently taking CS-50: Intro to Computer Science through Harvard.
    In week 5 we learn to use HTML, CSS, and Java; hence, this website.</p>
    <p>I became interested in data science after a gruelling year of introspective existential dread ridden soul searching.
    I graduate from Ithaca College May 2017 with a BS in chemistry. I immediately went back to my summer job working as a mover.
    I made what I thought was good money moving, wanted to pay off my debt and save to move to Colorado, and I really liked the
    job. There's something about really hard, mindless, manual labor that I enjoyed. After a year at Gentle Giant Moving Company,
    I moved to Boulder, CO to join my best friend, Robby "Perr Bear" Tolette. My plan was to get a job in chemistry and start my
    career.... I never did get that job in chemistry. I started working at Berkelhammer Tree Experts as an arborist in training.
    To anyone not familiar with treework...my job for the first few months was to walk around picking up sticks. Que the introspective
    existential dread ridden soul searching. I spent hours thinking about what I wanted to do next, how I could possibly get a job
    in a chemistry field, and what I wanted to do with my life. I eventually interviewed with Array Biopharma for a position
    making clinical trials drugs...I didn't get the job. More existential dread. </p>
