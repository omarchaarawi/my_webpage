        This was a final project for a data structures class. We were instructed to compare add and search times of
        USPS tracking numbers using various data structures we would implement without using libraries. During this project I chose to go beyond the requirements of the project
        by implementing a low maintenance trie structure capable of constant time lookups and adds. <a href = "https://github.com/omarchaarawi/Data_Structures_Final_Project">github link</a>
