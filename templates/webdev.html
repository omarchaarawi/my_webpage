       I have built two websites from scratch using the Flask framework. omarseven.com is my personal portfolio website. finance.com is a site 
       I built during a class. omarseven.com demonstrates more my style and web design, whereas finance.com makes heavier use of the flask API
       to include implementation of a login feature, database managemeant using sqlite, and API calls used to gather stock information in real
       time. I have repositories where anyone can view the source code for both pages. Please see the following links.
