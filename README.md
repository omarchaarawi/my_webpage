# my_webpage

## Intro
This is my personal webpage where I host some of my projects. It is built using a Flask framework. I built the site myself from scratch and host it from my own personal virtual server which I rent from DigitalOcean. I'll include a *Walkthrough* on how I got the site up and running. 

## Launching omarchaarawi.com
I primarily used two sources for this which proved to be super helpful. The first was https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/flask-app-on-digital-ocean.html#set-up-a-new-digital-ocean-droplet second was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goToXTC96Co. Thank you Corey Schafer and  Peter Kazarinoff for making such great tutorials on launching a website in a really safe secure way.
